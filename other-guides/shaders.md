# Shaders

To use shaders on the USW, you'll want to install Iris. Iris is a __fabric__ mod that requires Sodium.

### Installing Fabric
To start with installing shaders, you'll want to go to [fabric's website](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and download the installer for your device.

> **Step 1:** Open the installer. On Windows double click the installer, on Mac right click the installer and press Open.
> 
> **Step 2:** Make sure your Minecraft Launcher is closed. Select "Client" at the top of the installer and make sure your version is on 1.19.2.
> 
> **Step 3:** Make sure create profile is checked and press Install. After it's done installing you can close the installer.

### Installing Mods
Before installing any mods, you'll want to run your fabric profile for the first time. Start the launcher, and press play. Make sure the installation on the left is set to fabric.
After it's done loading, close the game again. Now you can install mods. By default you can install mods in the mods folder of your .minecraft folder.

The easiest way to find your mods folder is in the minecraft launcher.
> Open the Launcher, then go to (Installations -> Latest Release (or whatever profile you're using) -> Folder Icon to the Right -> Mods)

Then download these three mods. Make you download the version for __1.19.2__.

> 
> https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium
> 
> https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders

After you've downloaded them all, move them all into the mods folder you just found. You can now close that folder and start your game.
You should now see "Mods downloaded: 4" in the bottom left corner. This means you succesfully installed fabric and it's mods :D

### Installing Shaders
The recmomended shaders are the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders).
After you've downloaded your prefered shaders, you can enable them by dragging the downloaded .zip file into (Pause Menu -> Settings -> Video Settings -> Shader Packs).
Enable it by clicking on it, press apply, and enjoy.
