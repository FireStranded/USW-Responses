# Cheats

If you're looking to use creative mode / other admin commands you'll need to enable permissions first.

**__If you're on a server:__**
In your server console type ``op username`` where username is your minecraft username.

**__If you're on singleplayer:__**
Go to (Pause Menu -> Open to Lan -> Cheats ENABLED -> Done)
You'll have to do this every time you close and open your world on singleplayer.

You can now type /gamemode creative in chat to go into creative.
You can find a full list of comamnds at the [Official Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands)
