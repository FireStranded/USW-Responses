# Cheats

If you're looking to use creative mode / other admin commands you'll need to enable permissions first.

## **__If you're on a server:__** <br />
In your server console type ``op username`` where username is your minecraft username.

## **__If you're on singleplayer:__** <br />
Go to (Pause Menu -> Open to Lan -> Cheats ENABLED -> Done)<br />
You'll have to do this every time you close and open your world on singleplayer.

You can now type /gamemode creative in chat to go into creative.<br />
You can find a full list of commands on the [official wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands).
