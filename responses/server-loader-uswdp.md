<sup>tags: server-loader, uswdp, datapack, resourcepack</sup>

The Server-loader.jar and the USWDP.zip files are circumstantial files that you might not need.

### **__USW-ServerLoader.jar:__**

The server-loader.jar file is a file for Paper & Spigot servers. They're designed to install the USW resource pack easily on these servers. If you are not using paper or spigot servers, you can ignore this file. If you are using paper and spigot servers and would like to learn how to use the file, Step 5 of the guide in the post shows how to do it.

### **__USWDP.zip:__**

**Do Not Extract It.**

The USWDP.zip file is the datapack for the Java version of the world. This is for people who need to update their existing datapack. If you are only looking to install the world, you can ignore this file, since the world file already has the datapack and resource pack in it.
