# Aternos Installation
<sup>tags: install, aternos, server</sup>

If you already attempted to make a server on Aternos, please make sure it is **OFF** for this guide.

> __Step 1:__ Get the correct world download from the [TrixyBlox Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/TrixyBlox/posts). It should be a zip file named "USW-Java-X-Players". <br />
> __Step 2:__ Go to the "worlds" section in Aternos and click on the green generate button. Make sure the name is "world" and click generate again. <br />
> __Step 3:__ Upload the previously downloaded __.zip__ file by clicking the orange "Download" button. Find the __.zip__ file and double click it to select it. <br /> You may get an error here. If it's ID: -1 or ther eis no error, refresh the page and try again. If that doesn't work, try a different browser like Microsoft Edge.
> __Step 4:__ Once the world is uploaded, go to the "Files" section. Go to the server.properties section and scroll down to resourcepacks. Paste the following link that corresponds to the player limit of the world you downloaded.

> __25 Players:__ **ANSWER**

Bars appear like that when you don't have the __resourcepack__ installed correctly

**__If you're on a server:__**
If you're on a spigot/paper server, then install the server loader plugin from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/usw-server-loader.106454/ and put it in the "plugins" folder of your server. 

If you're not on spigot/paper then make sure the link corresponding to your player limit is in the resourcepack section of your server.properties file.
> 10 Players: http://resourcepack.host/dl/6OYRoGeXyU7EdAgEtK9gjnQlhUp3H0DY/USWRP-10-PLAYERS.zip
> 25 Players: http://resourcepack.host/dl/nIJPWxlIiEJxE8aEPTaNqbeQhFEU4LLq/USWRP-25-PLAYERS.zip
Then, restart your server.

If you're on a LAN server, make sure everyone downloads the resource pack corresponding to your player limit above, and put it in (Pause Menu -> Video Settings -> Resource Packs -> Open Folder)

**__If you're on singleplayer:__**
The resource pack should've come embedded in the world. Try holding F3+T to reload resource packs. If that doesn't work, try
installing the resourcepack manually from:

> 10 Players: http://resourcepack.host/dl/6OYRoGeXyU7EdAgEtK9gjnQlhUp3H0DY/USWRP-10-PLAYERS.zip
> 25 Players: http://resourcepack.host/dl/nIJPWxlIiEJxE8aEPTaNqbeQhFEU4LLq/USWRP-25-PLAYERS.zip

To install it, go to (Pause Menu -> Video Settings -> Resource Packs -> Open Folder) and drag the .zip file in there.
