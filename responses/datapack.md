Before trying any of these, please note that USW was not built to be run on forge servers.

Forge servers often cause problems that are not USW's fault and we cannot help you with.

Please try using Vanilla or Fabric.


**__This usually means you have a bad datapack.__**


If you're on a server:
> First try deleting the advancements folder of your world.
> Make sure your server is off before removing it, then start it up again after doing so.

**__For both servers and singleplayer:__**

If the above step hasn't worked and you haven't made any progress on the world, it's most recommended to just reinstall the world completely.
If you haven't made progress, then refer to the guide on updating your datapack below:

> First, download the USWDP.zip (ultimate survival world data pack) file from the patreon link that corresponds to your player limit (https://www.patreon.com/TrixyBlox/posts)
> 
> After you've downloaded the file, go into your (World Folder -> Datapacks) 
> 
> Delete the already existing USWDP.zip File and Replace it with the newly downloaded version.

**If you don't know how to locate your world folder**, it's located in your "__**saves**__"  folder.

The easiest way to find your saves folder is in the minecraft launcher.
> Open the Launcher, then go to (Installations -> Latest Release (or whatever profile you're using) -> Folder Icon to the Right -> Saves)

# Datapack Extraction
<sup>tags: extract, datapack</sup>

**__Only do this if your datapack is outdated or if there is an error when you join the world!__**

Make sure you do not extract the data pack!
Simply put the data pack in your datapack folder at (World Folder > Data Packs), deleting the old one if there is one already there.

**If you don't know how to locate your world folder**, it's located in your "__**saves**__"  folder.

The easiest way to find your saves folder is in the minecraft launcher.
> Open the Launcher, then go to (Installations -> Latest Release (or whatever profile you're using) -> Folder Icon to the Right -> Saves)
