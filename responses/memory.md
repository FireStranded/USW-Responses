# Memory Issues
<sup>tags: memory, ram, lag</sup>

If you're facing a lot of lag in your USW on java, you might need to allocate more ram.

First, you need to go onto the Minecraft launcher. Then click on installations. Then, you will click on the installation you are using for minecraft. (If you're just playing vanilla this should be the latest release)

Then, you need to click on more options on the lower right.

You should see something that says Java Arguments and some text below it. You're looking for the text that says  -Xmx2G -XX:

It should be in the front. In order to allocate more RAM, you need to change the 2 infront of the G. You should allocate around 1/4 of your total computer ram, so it should be 3 for people with 8gb of ram, 4 for people with 16gb of ram, and 8 for people with 32 gb of ram. After you changed the number, you want to hit save and try playing the world again.
