# "World Import Failed!" - MC:PE


### Android: 


Step 1: Download the Bedrock world from Trixy Blox's Patreon. Make sure it says ".mcworld.zip" at the end!!

Step 2: Go to your Downloads Folder in whatever your default file manager is. On Android, it may be "Files", "My Files", or "Downloads". On Windows, it should be your File Explorer. Look for the world you downloaded. You can sort your downloads by date or name, or search for the name.

Step 3: Rename the file, removing the ".zip" at the end. For example, if the download file is "My-World.mcworld.zip", change it to "My-World.mcworld". This will change the file extension, or file type, so that it can import itself to Minecraft.

Step 5: For Android users, download an app such as FX File Explorer. Your default file manager might not work for the next step, so use this app instead. Open the app, go to the "Downloads" folder on the first page, and find the world download.

Step 6: Open the world download file, and it should launch Minecraft automatically. It will take a few minutes, depending on your device, to import the world. When it is done, you will hear an Xbox notification sound, and a bar will appear saying "World imported successfully." You should now be able to open the world as you would your own.
