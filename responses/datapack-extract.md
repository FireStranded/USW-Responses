# Datapack Extraction
<sup>tags: extract, datapack</sup>

**__Only do this if your datapack is outdated or if there is an error when you join the world!__**

Make sure you do not extract the data pack!
Simply put the data pack in your datapack folder at (World Folder > Data Packs), deleting the old one if there is one already there.

**If you don't know how to locate your world folder**, it's located in your "__**saves**__"  folder.

The easiest way to find your saves folder is in the minecraft launcher.
> Open the Launcher, then go to (Installations -> Latest Release (or whatever profile you're using) -> Folder Icon to the Right -> Saves)
