# Dimension Issues
<sup>tags: dimensions, world, load</sup>

If you're on a server and one or two of your dimensions haven't loaded properly, it probably means you didn't delete the original 'world_nether' and 'world_end' when you first installed the world.

To fix this, you'll have to delete those files and restart your server so paper can seperate them properly.

> Step 1: Make sure you and anyone else on the server is in the overworld before attempting the next steps.
>
> Step 2: Stop your server.
>
> Step 3: Go into your Files and delete 'world_nether' and/or 'world_end', depending on which dimensions are working properly. Delete the dimensions that haven't loaded correctly.
>
> Step 4: Restart your server.
