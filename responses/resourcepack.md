Bars appear like that when you don't have the __resourcepack__ installed correctly

**__If you're on a server:__**
make sure the link corresponding to your player limit is in the resourcepack section of your server.properties file.

you're looking for the line with `resource-pack=` on it, paste the link you need below __after__ the equal sign

> 10 Players: 
> 
> `http://resourcepack.host/dl/6OYRoGeXyU7EdAgEtK9gjnQlhUp3H0DY/USWRP-10-PLAYERS.zip`

> 25 Players: 
> 
> `http://resourcepack.host/dl/nIJPWxlIiEJxE8aEPTaNqbeQhFEU4LLq/USWRP-25-PLAYERS.zip`

Then, restart your server.

If you're on a lan, make sure everyone downloads the resource pack corresponding to your player limit above, and put it in (Pause Menu -> Video Settings -> Resource Packs -> Open Folder)

**__If you're on singleplayer:__**
The resource pack should've come embedded in the world. Try holding F3+T to reload resource packs. If that doesn't work, try
installing the resourcepack manually from:

> 10 Players: http://resourcepack.host/dl/6OYRoGeXyU7EdAgEtK9gjnQlhUp3H0DY/USWRP-10-PLAYERS.zip

> 25 Players: http://resourcepack.host/dl/nIJPWxlIiEJxE8aEPTaNqbeQhFEU4LLq/USWRP-25-PLAYERS.zip

**do not unzip it**

To install it, go to Escape/Pause Menu -> Video Settings -> Resource Packs -> Open Folder and drag the .zip file in there.


# Resourcepack Extraction


Make sure you __**do not extract**__ the resource pack!
Simply put the resource pack in your resourcepack folder at: 
(Pause Menu -> Video Settings -> Resource Packs -> Open Folder)

Then enable it! You may have to hold F3 and press T to reload your resource packs.
