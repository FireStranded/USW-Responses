# Shaders

To use shaders on the USW, you'll want to install Iris. Iris is a __fabric__ mod that is recommended with Sodium.

### Installing Iris as a Launcher Profile (Like Optifine)

First, head over to [iris' website](https://irisshaders.net/download).

Click "Download Universal Jar", and double click on the .jar when it finishes downloading.

> For linux/mac you may have to right click on it and set it as an executable.

**1:** Make sure you're on the "Client" tab.

**2:** Select 1.19.2 or above.

**3:** Make sure "Create Profile" is ticked.

**4:** Click "Install"

After you've done that, make sure to set your launcher to use iris, and you'll be set.

### Installing Fabric
If you've already installed Iris as a profile, you should skip to "Installing Shaders".
To start with installing fabric, you'll want to go to [fabric's website](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and download the installer for your device.

> **Step 1:** Open the installer. On Windows double click the installer, on Mac right click the installer and press Open.
> 
> **Step 2:** Make sure your Minecraft Launcher is closed. Select "Client" at the top of the installer and make sure your version is on 1.19.2.
> 
> **Step 3:** Make sure create profile is checked and press Install. After it's done installing you can close the installer.

### Installing Mods
Before installing any mods, you'll want to run your fabric profile for the first time. Start the launcher, and press play. Make sure the installation on the left is set to fabric.
After it's done loading, close the game again. Now you can install mods. By default you can install mods in the mods folder of your .minecraft folder.

The easiest way to find your mods folder is in the minecraft launcher.
> Open the Launcher, then go to (Installations -> Latest Release (or whatever profile you're using) -> Folder Icon to the Right -> Mods)

Then download these three mods. Make you download the version for __1.19.2__.
> https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api
> 
> https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium
> 
> https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders

After you've downloaded them all, move them all into the mods folder you just found. You can now close that folder and start your game.
You should now see "Mods downloaded: 4" in the bottom left corner. This means you succesfully installed fabric and it's mods :D

### Installing Shaders
The recmomended shaders are the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders).
After you've downloaded your prefered shaders, you can enable them by dragging the downloaded .zip file into (Pause Menu -> Settings -> Video Settings -> Shader Packs).
Enable it by clicking on it, press apply, and enjoy.
