If you've been trying to upload your realms multiple times but you keep running into an error, this is a way to check if your world was secretley uploaded.

Step one: Edit your realm.

On the minecraft play screen, you should be able to see the realm you've been trying to upload the world to. To the right of it there should be a pencil icon. Click on that.
