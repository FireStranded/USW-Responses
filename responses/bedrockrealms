If you've been trying to upload your realms multiple times but you keep running into an error, this is a way to check if your world was secretley uploaded.

Step one: Edit your realm.

On the minecraft play screen, you should be able to see the realm you've been trying to upload the world to. To the right of it there should be a pencil icon. Click on that.

After that you should see a box with your world in it. It'll most likely say "My world".

Step two: Check your world for backups.

Click on this world, and then click on edit world.

In the edit menu, there should be a tab called 'backups' Click on that.

Then, when you're in your backups, search for an abnormally large world. While the typical vanilla world would be under 1 mb, this abnormally large world would be in the hundreds of mb. Think between 500 and 700 mb.

This world is your USW. Click on it and then click on replace. This should give you a much easier time uploading the world with less errors.

Step three: Confirmation.

After you've uploaded the world, join it to ensure that its working properly. Then, you can either play on this realm or transfer it as you wish.
