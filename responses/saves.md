# Saves Folder
<sup>tags: saves, folder, .minecraft</sup>

If your worlds aren't properly showing up in game, that means you haven't properly put the world in the saves folder.

The easiest way to find your saves folder is in the minecraft launcher.
Open the Launcher, then go to (Installations -> Latest Release -> Folder Icon to the Right -> Saves)
